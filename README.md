# 🌙 MagicStory - AI Bedtime Storyteller

**MagicStory** is an interactive application that generates personalized bedtime stories for children and narrates them with a soothing, lifelike neural voice.

## 🚀 Features
* **Unique Stories:** Instantly generated based on the child's name, age, and a chosen theme.
* **Audio Narration:** Uses advanced neural text-to-speech for a human-like voice (no robotic sounds!).
